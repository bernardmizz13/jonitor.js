A runtime verification tool for JavaScript web applications.

Runtime verification is a method to verify a system's behaviour at runtime. Runtime verification is typically divided in the following parts:

-system - the system under test
-instrumentation - the process by which the monitor becomes attached to the system
-monitor - the core of the runtime verification that performs the verification
-properties - the properties that the monitor uses to check the system's behaviour
